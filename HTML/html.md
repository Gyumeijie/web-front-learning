# HTML Entities
There are some characters that have special meaning in HTML document-the obvious ones being
the < and > characters. You will sometimes need to use these characters in you content without
wanting them to be interpreted as HTML. To do this, you use ***HTML entities***.

An entitiy is a code the browser substitutes for the special character. Each special character
has an **entity number** that you can include in you content to represent ther character. But not
every special character has a  corresponding **name entity**; generally speaking the more popular 
speicail characters have a name.

# HTML Attributes

In html, each element has some attributes and we can **configure** elements using attributes. And
each attributes can fall into the following two categories:

1. ***local attributes***

By it very name, these attributes are defined by each element locally and give the author the ablility to 
control some aspect of the unique behavior of an element.

2. ***global attributes***

Similarly, These **configure** the behaviour that is common to ***all*** elements. You can apply every
global attribute to every element, **although this doesn't always lead to meaningful or useful behaviour 
change.**
