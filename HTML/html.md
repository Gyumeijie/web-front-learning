# HTML Entities
There are some characters that have special meaning in HTML document-the obvious ones being
the < and > characters. You will sometimes need to use these characters in you content without
wanting them to be interpreted as HTML. To do this, you use ***HTML entities***.

An entitiy is a code the browser substitutes for the special character. Each special character
has an **entity number** that you can include in you content to represent ther character. But not
every special character has a  corresponding **name entity**; generally speaking the more popular 
speicail characters have a name.
